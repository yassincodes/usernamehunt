// idea
a web app for you to find your next awesome username
usernameHunt gonna generate you a username similar to what famous influencers has lol

// why I'm building this
I found it is the best why to learn more about array manipulation and how online stores work
and also to find a new username

// what makes usernameHunt different
currently there is a lot of websites doiing so (like: ...) but they all generate random names
that are not for ppl who wanna build a brand for themselves

// market
I do not know how to calculate the market 
But as I found visitors of ... passed 1 million
visitors of ... passed 500k 

// monetizing
finding a sponsor
google ads

// problem
thousands of ppl are starting their social media careers
I think it is a great problem, they are looking for great usernames but all great usernames are taken
also ppl feel more comfortable using a certain username if they see some famous dude using it also

// marketing idea:
share website with tiktokers who help other tiktokers build their brand like jtbarnett
send website to brands with bad usernames
tweet some tweets and videos
make a button called do you have 1k followers and used my app. Plz drop me a message 
pinterest and reddit
productHunt
talk with tiktokers

// tweets
* I thought that by finishing the react and javascript parts in my app things will get easier
but discovered that the css is the hardest
* HowItWas      HowItWents
* had to manipulate the same 2 strings 300 times to build this LOL. All code is in the front end haha

// things to add
=> categories (do it like namecheap)
=> usernameHunt for companies 
=> usernameHunt for website domain names
=> a book that contains advices to find a great username
=> articles on how to find a great username
=> username checker 
=> username calculator
=> organise usernames by calculator or by controlling with your hand
=> I find my username using usernameHunt dashboard + we will show names organised by how many followers you have
=> how your username will look like in different social media
=> your username written in a catchy way (just to feel better about it lol)
